        <h4>6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>
            We take legally mandated and commercially reasonable security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard Personal Data from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Data, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of Personal Data between your system and ours in addition to the storage of this information, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to personal information. Your account is also protected by a password for your privacy and security and you must prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, limiting access to our Services to only individuals authorized to do so (i.e., members of your household), and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Please keep in mind, however, that no method of storage or transmission over the Internet is completely secure, so your use of our Services and provision of information to us is at your own risk.
