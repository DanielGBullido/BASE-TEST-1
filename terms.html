                                    These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You agree that resolution of any dispute or claim arising out of or related to these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in New York City, NY.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    If you believe you have a dispute or claim against us arising out of your use of the Services or under these Terms, you agree to first discuss the matter informally with us for at least 30 days. To do that, you must give us written notice, which will include your full name and contact information, the nature and basis giving rise to your dispute or claim and your proposed resolution, sent to the address below.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                     If we are unable to resolve your concerns informally within 30 days after our receipt of your notice, you may file a claim in small claims court so long as you proceed only on an individual basis or commence an arbitration proceeding, which means YOU ARE AGREEING TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, HAVE A JURY TRIAL AND LEAD OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"), then in effect. For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST BASE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING.

                                    Base members can earn a Gift Card, specified above, if: (i) a referred friend clicks on their referral link to create a valid Base membership; and (ii) the referred friend successfully pays for their first month’s membership. The referring member will be credited with the specified gift card amount within one week of the completion of the referred friend’s first month’s payment. The maximum Gift Cards that can be earned per Member will be $10,000 USD total made by referred friends unless indicated otherwise. There can be only 1 referral code redeemed per household (address).
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Referred friends who have signed up using a valid referral link will also receive credit in the form of a coupon or coupons in the amount(s) indicated in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials that can be used for their first month’s membership. Coupon codes that are not automatically applied must be entered during checkout. Coupon codes may not be transferred to another person, exchanged for cash, or combined with other Base referral programs or incentives.

                                     Base may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or a user’s ability to participate in it at any time for any reason.
